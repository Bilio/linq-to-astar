## Validity Test

Each test class covers an algorithm and consists of at least three test cases:

1. Test if first step of the solution is equal to `start` and last step is equal to `goal`.
2. Test if the solution is continuous. Distance between `X` or distance between `Y` of each two steps must be exactly equal to `unit`.
3. Test if the solution contains invalid steps.

Validity test does not verify whether the path is best solution.
